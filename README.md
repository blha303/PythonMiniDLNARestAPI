PythonMiniDLNARestAPI
=====================
MiniDLNA Python REST API server and associated Tkinter GUI for reading from it

Usage
-----

* Put the server.py on your media server. Make sure you have Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Restless installed (and all their dependencies)
* Once you're sure it works, run it in screen with `screen python minidlnarestserver.py`, or in some Flask wrapper.
* The GUI should run on any machine with Python >= 2.7. You'll need to change the hostname at the top of the file to a hostname or IP.
